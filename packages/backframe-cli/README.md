# The official cli for bootstrapping backframe based projects

Backframe is an open-source project for easily developing and deploying API(s) all from a web interface without necessarily having to write any code yourself.

---

Get started by installing the backframe cli:

```bash
#with npm:
npm install -g @backframe/cli

#with yarn:
yarn add global @backframe/cli
```

Once installed, you can start a new backframe project by typing the following into your terminal/console:

```bash
bf new server
```
You will be prompted for the options to setup your server such as:
- What types of API(s) you would like to implement
- What database you will be connecting to
- Other options such as Firebase interoperability, websockets etc.
