## Inspiration for backframe

I dont know about you, but the first time I used firebase, I felt awesome. It was amazing having access to all these tools that I didnt have to create myself. Auth, database mgmt, Email services and even analytics! But a bit further into my developer journey, I craved for something more than firebase. I wanted more control over the tools I'm using. While other providers like Supabase, Appwrite and Nhost are open source, they are still not very customizable. You can only use what the creators of these BaaS's have made available to you. That was the beginning of a thought process that eventually resulted in backframe. The question of what if I could have a Backend that allows me to customize/take total control if need be, but not without sacrificing the no-config option that is offered with Backends.
I knew what I wanted but the path to get there wasn't clear. Some early implementations were more of a generator for express with a very weird api. But as time went by, the api stablized/become better. While the frontend ecosystem gets better and better everyday, with better tooling, backend tools have remained relatively same. Backframe took a lot of inspiration from frameworks such as remix and other tooling
It took a while and a lot of coding and recoding but I think that backframe is now everything I wanted it to be. It's a framework. A framework that allows you to write as little code as you'd like or as much you'd need to create your own backend.
fw like nest have lot of boilerplate, simplicity of bf

# How it works

Backframe took a while to get to the syntax/api it presents today. At it's core, its simply wrapper around express providing.

  - Gee, I had so much fun creating that backend from scratch: "Said noone ever"
  - But with backframe, It's super easy, barely an inconveniece
